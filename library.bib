With more content being delivered over the top, the complexity of spatial access to the video is increased by the need to perform bitrate adaptation to react to network variations. In this paper, we describe how spatial access can be performed in an adaptive HTTP streaming context, using tiling of the source content, MPEG-DASH and its SRD extensions. We describe a configurable implementation of these technologies, within the GPAC open-source player, allowing experimentations of different adaptation policies for tiled video content.},

	abstract = {© 2017 ACM. 360 degree video is a new generation of video streaming technology that promises greater immersiveness than standard video streams. This level of immersiveness is similar to that produced by virtual reality devices - users can control the field of view using head movements rather than needing to manipulate external devices. Although 360 degree video could revolutionize streaming technology, large scale adoption is hindered by a number of factors. 360 degree video streams have larger bandwidth requirements, require faster responsiveness to user inputs, and users may be more sensitive to lower quality streams. In this paper, we review standard approaches toward 360 degree video encoding and compare these to a new, as yet unpublished, approach by Oculus which we refer to as the offset cubic projection. Compared to the standard cubic encoding, the offset cube encodes a distorted version of the spherical surface, devoting more information (i.e., pixels) to the view in a chosen direction. We estimate that the offset cube representation can produce better or similar visual quality while using less than 50% pixels under reasonable assumptions about user behavior, resulting in 5.6% to 16.4% average savings in video bitrate. During 360 degree video streaming, Oculus uses a combination of quality level adaptation and view orientation adaptation. We estimate that this combination of streaming adaptation in two dimensions can cause over 57% extra segments to be downloaded compared to an ideal downloading strategy, wasting 20% of the total downloading bandwidth.},

	abstract = {360° live video streaming is becoming increasingly popular. While providing viewers with enriched experience, 360° live video streaming is challenging to achieve since it requires a significantly higher bandwidth and a powerful computation infrastructure. A deeper understanding of this emerging system would benefit both viewers and system designers. Although prior works have extensively studied regular video streaming and 360° video on demand streaming, we for the first time investigate the performance of 360° live video streaming. We conduct a systematic measurement of YouTube's 360° live video streaming using various metrics in multiple practical settings. Our key findings suggest that viewers are advised not to live stream 4K 360° video, even when dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP (DASH) is enabled. Instead, 1080p 360° live video can be played smoothly. However, the extremely large one-way video delay makes it only feasible for delay-tolerant broadcasting applications rather than real-time interactive applications. More importantly, we have concluded from our results that the primary design weakness of current systems lies in inefficient server processing, non-optimal rate adaptation, and conservative buffer management. Our research insight will help to build a clear understanding of today's 360° live video streaming and lay a foundation for future research on this emerging yet relatively unexplored area.},

  abstract  = {Online streaming of Virtual Reality and 360 • videos is rapidly grow-ing, as more and more major content providers and news outlets adopt the format to enrich the user experience. We characterize 360 • videos by examining several thousand YouTube videos across more than a dozen categories. 360 • videos, at trst sight, seem to pose a challenge for the network to stream because of their substan-tially higher bit rates and larger number of resolutions. However, a careful examination of video characteristics reveals that there are signiicant opportunities for reducing the actual bit rate delivered to client devices based on the user's seld of view. We study the bit rate and the motion in 360 • videos, and compare them against regular videos by investigating several important metrics. We end that 360 • videos are less variable in terms of bit rate, and have less motion than regular videos. Our expectation is that variability in the bit rates due to the motion of the camera in regular videos (or switching between cameras) is now translated to responsiveness requirements for end to end 360 • streaming architectures.},

  abstract        = {Delivering wide-angle and high-resolution spherical panoramic video content entails a high streaming bitrate. This imposes challenges when panorama clips are consumed in virtual reality (VR) head-mounted displays (HMD). The reason is that the HMDs typically require high spatial and temporal fidelity contents and strict low-latency in order to guarantee the user's sense of presence while using them. In order to alleviate the problem, we propose to store two versions of the same video content at different resolutions, each divided into multiple tiles using the High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) standard. According to the user's present viewport, a set of tiles is transmitted in the highest captured resolution, while the remaining parts are transmitted from the low-resolution version of the same content. In order to enable selectively choosing different combinations, the tile sets are encoded to be independently decodable. We further study the trade- off in the choice of tiling scheme and its impact on compression and streaming bitrate performances. The results indicate streaming bitrate saving from 30% to 40%, depending on the selected tiling scheme, when compared to streaming the entire video content.},

Recent work has shown that capacity estimation is fraught with difficulties because of complex interactions between the ABR control loop, HTTP server performance and TCP congestion control. Estimation-based rate selection algorithms can lead to unnecessary rebuffering events and suboptimal video quality. This paper argues that we should do away with estimating network capacity, and instead directly observe and control the playback buffer--which is the state variable we are most interested in controlling. We present a class of "buffer-based" rate selection algorithms that reduce the rebuffering rate while allowing us to control the delivered video quality. We implemented our algorithms inside the Netflix video client and ran a series of experiments spanning millions of Netflix users around the world. Our results show that by doing away with estimating network capacity and instead focusing on buffer occupancy, we can reduce rebuffer rates by 20% while holding video rate constant.},

  abstract        = {DASH, or Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP, relies on a rate adaptation component to decide on which representation to download for each video segment. A plethora of rate adaptation al- gorithms has been proposed in recent years. The decisions of which bitrate to download made by these algorithms largely depend on several factors: estimated network throughput, buffer occupancy, and buffer capacity. Yet, these algorithms are not informed by a fun- damental relationship between these factors and the chosen bitrate, and as a result, we found that they do not perform consistently in all scenarios, and require parameter tuning to work well under different buffer capacity. In this paper, we model a DASH client as an M / D / 1 / K queue, which allows us to calculate the expected buffer occupancy given a bitrate choice, network throughput, and buffer capacity. Using this model, we propose QUETRA, a simple rate adaptation algorithm. We evaluated QUETRA under a diverse set of scenarios and found that, despite its simplicity, it leads to better quality of experience (7% - 140%) than existing algorithms.},

  abstract        = {User-perceived quality-of-experience (QoE) is critical in Internet video applications as it impacts revenues for content providers and delivery systems. Given that there is little support in the network for optimizing such measures, bottlenecks could occur anywhere in the delivery system. Consequently, a robust bitrate adaptation algorithm in client-side players is critical to ensure good user experience. Previous studies have shown key limitations of state-of-art commercial solutions and proposed a range of heuristic fixes. Despite the emergence of several proposals, there is still a distinct lack of consensus on: (1) How best to design this client-side bitrate adaptation logic (e.g., use rate estimates vs. buffer occupancy); (2) How well specific classes of approaches will perform under diverse operating regimes (e.g., high throughput variability); or (3) How do they actually balance different QoE objectives (e.g., startup delay vs. rebuffering). To this end, this paper makes three key technical contributions. First, to bring some rigor to this space, we develop a principled control-theoretic model to reason about a broad spectrum of strategies. Second, we propose a novel model predictive control algorithm that can optimally combine throughput and buffer occupancy information to outperform traditional approaches. Third, we present a practical implementation in a reference video player to validate our approach using realistic trace-driven emulations.},

  abstract        = {Today, 360-degree video streaming has become a popular Internet service with the rise of affordable virtual reality (VR) technologies. However, streaming 360-degree videos suffers from the prohibitive bandwidth demand. Existing bandwidth-efficient solutions mainly focus on exploiting the inherent spatial adaptability of 360-degree videos, delivering only video content (spatially-cut tiles) in the viewer's region of interest (ROI) with higher quality. Temporal adaptability, which has been widely leveraged in HTTP streaming, has not been well exploited to select proper quality for video segments according to the bandwidth variations. When these two dimensions of adaptability are jointly considered, bitrate selection for the tiles become more complicated and challenging. The importance of a tile with a spatial coordination played at a specific time should be quantified so that we can determine how to allocate bandwidth for improving the viewer's quality of experience. Furthermore, viewer's head orientation prediction is highly variable, which makes the determination of important tiles highly dynamic. In addition, network fluctuations are very common on the Internet. To overcome these challenges, we propose Bi-Adaptive Streaming for 360-degree videos (BAS-360°). In BAS-360°, both spatial and temporal adaptabilities are explored in the bitrate selection for different tiles. The objective is to minimize the bandwidth waste by allocating bandwidth to more important tiles (the tiles that are more likely to be watched). To tackle the high variability of visual region prediction and the unpredictable network fluctuations, we employ two features provided by HTT P /2: stream termination and stream priority, to efficiently organize tile delivery. Evaluation results show that BAS-360° outperforms naive tile-based 360-degree video streaming strategies when network fluctuations or errors in viewport predictions occur. {\textcopyright} 2018 IEEE.},

  abstract        = {Modern video players employ complex algorithms to adapt the bitrate of the video that is shown to the user. Bitrate adaptation requires a tradeoff between reducing the probability that the video freezes and enhancing the quality of the video shown to the user. A bitrate that is too high leads to frequent video freezes (i.e., rebuffering), while a bitrate that is too low leads to poor video quality. Video providers segment the video into short chunks and encode each chunk at multiple bitrates. The video player adaptively chooses the bitrate of each chunk that is downloaded, possibly choosing different bitrates for successive chunks. While bitrate adaptation holds the key to a good quality of experience for the user, current video players use ad-hoc algorithms that are poorly understood. We formulate bitrate adaptation as a utility maximization problem and devise an online control algorithm called BOLA that uses Lyapunov optimization techniques to minimize rebuffering and maximize video quality.We prove that BOLA achieves a time-average utility that is within an additive term O(1/V) of the optimal value, for a control parameter V related to the video buffer size. Further, unlike prior work, our algorithm does not require any prediction of available network bandwidth. We empirically validate our algorithm in a simulated network environment using an extensive collection of network traces. We show that our algorithm achieves near-optimal utility and in many cases significantly higher utility than current state-of-the-art algorithms. Our work has immediate impact on real-world video players and for the evolving DASH standard for video transmission.},

This kind of videos can render a virtual reality (VR) environment via a headmounted display (HMD). However, understanding the quality of experience (QoE) of 360 videos is a big challenge because user experience in VR is a very complex phenomenon. In this paper, the QoE of 360 videos is considered in terms of four aspects, namely perceptual quality, presence, acceptability, and cybersickness. Subjective tests are designed to investigate the influences of important factors including encoding parameters, content characteristics, and device types on QoE aspects. In addition, a comparison of perceptual quality and acceptability between VR and non-VR rendering modes, which refer to watching 360 videos with and without using an HMD respectively, is also made in this study. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that covers these four QoE aspects and a large number of influence factors.},

However, it is still a big challenge to understand Quality of Experience (QoE) of 360-degree video since user experience during watching 360-degree video is a very complex phenomenon. In this paper, we aim to investigate four QoE aspects of 360-degree video, namely, perceptual quality, presence, cybersickness, and acceptability. In addition, four key QoE-affecting factors of encoding parameters, content motion, rendering device, and rendering mode are considered in our study. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that covers a large number of factors and QoE aspects of 360-degree video. In this study, a subjective experiment is conducted using 60 video versions generated from three original 360-degree videos. Based on statistical analysis of the obtained results, various findings on the impacts of the factors on the QoE aspects are provided. In particular, regarding the impacts of encoding parameters, it is found that the difference of QoE is negligible between video versions encoded at 4 K and 2.5 K resolutions. Also, it is suggested that 360-degree video should not be encoded at HD resolution or lower when watching in VR mode using Head Mounted Display. In addition, the bitrate for good QoE varies widely across different video contents. With respect to the content motion factor, its impact is statistically significant on the perceptual quality, presence, and cybersickness. In a comparison of two rendering device sets used in this study, there is no statistically significant difference found for the acceptability and cybersickness. However, the differences of the perceptual quality and presence are indicated to be statistically significant. Regarding the rendering mode, a comparison between VR and non-VR modes is also conducted. Although the non-VR mode always achieves higher perceptual quality scores and higher acceptability rates, more than a half of the viewers prefer the VR mode to the non-VR mode when watching versions encoded at the resolutions of fHD or higher. By contrast, the non-VR mode is preferred at the HD resolution.},

  abstract = {360-degree video has become increasingly popular nowadays. For effective transmission of bandwidth-intensive 360-degree video over networks, viewport-adaptive streaming has been introduced. In this article, we evaluate, for the first time, ten existing methods to understand the effectiveness of tile-based viewport adaptive streaming of 360-degree video. Experimental results show that tile-based methods can improve the average V-PSNR by up to 4.3 dB compared to a non-tiled method under low delay settings. Here, the V-PSNR is computed as the peak signal-to-noise ratio of the adapted viewport compared to the corresponding origin viewport. Also, different methods show different tradeoffs between average viewport quality and viewport quality variations. Especially, the performances of most tile-based methods decrease quickly as the segment duration and/or buffer size increase for the content with no main focus. Even, under long delay settings like HTTP Adaptive Streaming, it is found that the simple non-tiled method appears to be the best one. For the content with a strong viewing focus, it is found that the tile-based methods are less influenced by the segment duration and the buffer size. In addition, a comparison of the performances of the tile selection methods using two popular viewport estimation methods is conducted. It is interesting that there is only little difference found in performances of tile selection methods. The findings of this study are useful for service providers to make decisions on deployment of streaming solutions.},
